Auth-Service
A backend-only Node.js and Express.js project built to learn and understand authentication and authorization using JWT and MongoDB Atlas.

Overview
Auth-Service is a learning-focused project that demonstrates how authentication and authorization work in a Node.js backend. It implements JWT-based authentication, secure password hashing, and protected routes, providing a solid foundation for building secure APIs.

Features
User Authentication – Register and log in securely.
JWT-based Authorization – Access protected routes with tokens.
Password Hashing – Uses bcrypt for secure storage.
MongoDB Atlas Integration – Cloud database for storing user data.
RESTful API – Clean and organized endpoints.

Tech Stack
